# TENNIS LINE SWEEPER

The tennis court is all brushed off to perfection and only the clearing of the now dusty lines is left. You fetch your tool of choice and as you reach the first line you return to the age old question:
What is the optimal way of sweeping the lines?

No more! Unleash this ant colony and let them find the optimal path!

## TODO
 - Unit tests
 - Cmake
 - Wasm check
 - Original problem verify

## RESOURCES
 - Boost Graph
 - Clp https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp
 - Draw graph: http://sigmajs.org/ (Put path index on graph edge instead of node? Arrows for direction also perhaps)
 - Handle json: https://github.com/nlohmann/json
